# Living Large On An Intern Salary- An API for choosing a place to live

I created this application as I was looking for a place to live after graduation. After a few weeks of trying to work with a messy Google doc and spreadsheet, I thought I could code a way to keep track of my housing preferences.

This application allows users to store information such as location, price, bedrooms, bathrooms and distance to work in one database.

I have divided my housing preferences into three categories: downtown, midtown and suburban.

This API was built using PHP with Laravel as the framework. Users are able to create, read, update and delete items from the database via AJAX.
